## Step 1: Load Context

Load phase operation context:
```bash
INIT=$(node ".rcode/bin/rcode-tools.cjs" init phase-op "${PHASE_ARG}")
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
```

Extract from init JSON: `phase_dir`, `phase_number`, `has_plans`, `plan_count`.

Orchestrator provides CONTEXT.md content in the verification prompt. If provided, parse for locked decisions, discretion areas, deferred ideas.

```bash
ls "$phase_dir"/*-SPRINT.md 2>/dev/null
# Read research for Nyquist validation data
cat "$phase_dir"/*-RESEARCH.md 2>/dev/null
node ".rcode/bin/rcode-tools.cjs" roadmap get-phase "$phase_number"
ls "$phase_dir"/*-BRIEF.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Extract:** Phase goal, requirements (decompose goal), locked decisions, deferred ideas.

## Step 2: Load All Plans

Use rcode-tools to validate plan structure:

```bash
for plan in "$PHASE_DIR"/*-SPRINT.md; do
  echo "=== $plan ==="
  PLAN_STRUCTURE=$(node ".rcode/bin/rcode-tools.cjs" verify plan-structure "$plan")
  echo "$PLAN_STRUCTURE"
done
```

Parse JSON result: `{ valid, errors, warnings, task_count, tasks: [{name, hasFiles, hasAction, hasVerify, hasDone}], frontmatter_fields }`

Map errors/warnings to verification dimensions:
- Missing frontmatter field → `task_completeness` or `must_haves_derivation`
- Task missing elements → `task_completeness`
- Wave/depends_on inconsistency → `dependency_correctness`
- Checkpoint/autonomous mismatch → `task_completeness`

## Step 3: Parse must_haves

Extract must_haves from each plan using rcode-tools:

```bash
MUST_HAVES=$(node ".rcode/bin/rcode-tools.cjs" frontmatter get "$PLAN_PATH" --field must_haves)
```

Returns JSON: `{ truths: [...], artifacts: [...], key_links: [...] }`

**Expected structure:**

```yaml
must_haves:
  truths:
    - "User can log in with email/password"
    - "Invalid credentials return 401"
  artifacts:
    - path: "src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts"
      provides: "Login endpoint"
      min_lines: 30
  key_links:
    - from: "src/components/LoginForm.tsx"
      to: "/api/auth/login"
      via: "fetch in onSubmit"
```

Aggregate across plans for full picture of what phase delivers.

## Step 4: Check Requirement Coverage

Map requirements to tasks:

```
Requirement          | Plans | Tasks | Status
---------------------|-------|-------|--------
User can log in      | 01    | 1,2   | COVERED
User can log out     | -     | -     | MISSING
Session persists     | 01    | 3     | COVERED
```

For each requirement: find covering task(s), verify action is specific, flag gaps.

**Sub-behavior check (concrete, not eyeballed):** A task ID in the `Tasks` column is not proof of coverage by itself. For each requirement:
1. Split the requirement's acceptance-criteria text (from ROADMAP.md/PRD, or the `must_haves.truths` derived from it) into discrete sub-behaviors — each verb phrase is one sub-behavior (e.g. "user can reset password" -> ["request reset email", "receive token", "verify token", "set new password"]).
2. For each sub-behavior, check the covering task's `<action>` and `<verify>` text contains a concrete reference to it (a matching noun/verb, file, or endpoint) — not just the requirement's headline phrase.
3. If one task covers a multi-sub-behavior requirement, list which sub-behaviors its action/verify actually address. Any sub-behavior with zero matching action/verify text is **unaddressed**.
4. Status is `COVERED` only if every sub-behavior maps to at least one action/verify pair. If any sub-behavior is unaddressed, status is `PARTIAL` and is a **blocker**, not a note — list the specific missing sub-behavior(s), not a generic "may be incomplete" remark.

```
Requirement          | Plans | Tasks | Status  | Missing sub-behaviors
----------------------|-------|-------|---------|----------------------
User can reset password | 01  | 4     | PARTIAL | token verification, email send
```

**Exhaustive cross-check:** Also read PROJECT.md requirements (not just phase goal). Verify no PROJECT.md requirement relevant to this phase is silently dropped. A requirement is "relevant" if the ROADMAP.md explicitly maps it to this phase or if the phase goal directly implies it — do NOT flag requirements that belong to other phases or future work. Any unmapped relevant requirement is an automatic blocker — list it explicitly in issues.

## Step 5: Validate Task Structure

Use rcode-tools plan-structure verification (already run in Step 2):

```bash
PLAN_STRUCTURE=$(node ".rcode/bin/rcode-tools.cjs" verify plan-structure "$PLAN_PATH")
```

The `tasks` array in the result shows each task's completeness:
- `hasFiles` — files element present
- `hasAction` — action element present
- `hasVerify` — verify element present
- `hasDone` — done element present

**Check:** valid task type (auto, checkpoint:*, tdd), auto tasks have files/action/verify/done, action is specific, verify is runnable, done is measurable.

**For manual validation of specificity** (rcode-tools checks structure, not content quality):
```bash
grep -B5 "</task>" "$PHASE_DIR"/*-SPRINT.md | grep -v "<verify>"
```

## Step 6: Verify Dependency Graph

```bash
for plan in "$PHASE_DIR"/*-SPRINT.md; do
  grep "depends_on:" "$plan"
done
```

Validate: all referenced plans exist, no cycles, wave numbers consistent, no forward references. If A -> B -> C -> A, report cycle.

## Step 7: Check Key Links

For each key_link in must_haves: find source artifact task, check if action mentions the connection, flag missing wiring.

```
key_link: Chat.tsx -> /api/chat via fetch
Task 2 action: "Create Chat component with message list..."
Missing: No mention of fetch/API call → Issue: Key link not planned
```

## Step 8: Assess Scope

```bash
grep -c "<task" "$PHASE_DIR"/$PHASE-01-SPRINT.md
grep "files_modified:" "$PHASE_DIR"/$PHASE-01-SPRINT.md
```

Thresholds: 2-3 tasks/plan good, 4 warning, 5+ blocker (split required).

## Step 9: Verify must_haves Derivation

**Truths:** user-observable (not "bcrypt installed" but "passwords are secure"), testable, specific.

**Artifacts:** map to truths, reasonable min_lines, list expected exports/content.

**Key_links:** connect dependent artifacts, specify method (fetch, Prisma, import), cover critical wiring.

## Step 9.5: Verify File References (NEW)

Before step 10, add pre-flight reference verification:

```bash
PLAN_TEXT=$(cat "$PLAN_PATH")
VERIFY_RESULT=$(node -e "
const cr = require('.rcode/bin/lib/code-references.cjs');
const fs = require('fs');
const text = fs.readFileSync(process.argv[1], 'utf8');
const refs = cr.extractReferences(text);
const result = cr.verifyReferences(refs, process.cwd());
console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
" "$PLAN_PATH")
```

Check result:
- If `summary.ratio < 0.5`: **BLOCKER** — "Plan references files/symbols that don't exist. Plan was built on hallucinated findings."
- If `summary.ratio >= 0.5 AND < 0.8`: **WARNING** — List missing files/symbols, suggest re-planning with /rcode-debug
- If `summary.ratio >= 0.8`: **INFO** — Most references verified, proceed

Append to verification output:

```markdown
## File References Verification

**Verified:** {summary.verified} / {summary.total} ({summary.ratio}%)
**Status:** ✅ PASS / ⚠️  WARNING / ❌ FAIL

{if missing refs:}
Missing files: {list}
Missing symbols: {list}
{hint}
```

## Step 10: Determine Overall Status

**passed:** All requirements covered, all tasks complete, dependency graph valid, key links planned, scope within budget, must_haves properly derived.

**issues_found:** One or more blockers or warnings. Plans need revision.

Severities: `blocker` (must fix), `warning` (should fix), `info` (suggestions).

</verification_process>

<examples>

## Scope Exceeded (most common miss)

**Plan 01 analysis:**
```
Tasks: 5
Files modified: 12
  - prisma/schema.prisma
  - src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts
  - src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts
  - src/app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts
  - src/middleware.ts
  - src/lib/auth.ts
  - src/lib/jwt.ts
  - src/components/LoginForm.tsx
  - src/components/LogoutButton.tsx
  - src/app/login/page.tsx
  - src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
  - src/types/auth.ts
```

5 tasks exceeds 2-3 target, 12 files is high, auth is complex domain → quality degradation risk.

```yaml
issue:
  dimension: scope_sanity
  severity: blocker
  description: "Plan 01 has 5 tasks with 12 files - exceeds context budget"
  plan: "01"
  metrics:
    tasks: 5
    files: 12
    estimated_context: "~80%"
  fix_hint: "Split into: 01 (schema + API), 02 (middleware + lib), 03 (UI components)"
```

</examples>

<issue_structure>

## Issue Format

```yaml
issue:
  plan: "16-01"              # Which plan (null if phase-level)
  dimension: "task_completeness"  # Which dimension failed
  severity: "blocker"        # blocker | warning | info
  description: "..."
  task: 2                    # Task number if applicable
  fix_hint: "..."
```

## Severity Levels

**blocker** - Must fix before execution
- Missing requirement coverage
- Missing required task fields
- Circular dependencies
- Scope > 5 tasks per plan

**warning** - Should fix, execution may work
- Scope 4 tasks (borderline)
- Implementation-focused truths
- Minor wiring missing

**info** - Suggestions for improvement
- Could split for better parallelization
- Could improve verification specificity

Return all issues as a structured `issues:` YAML list (see dimension examples for format).

<anti_patterns>

**DO NOT** check code existence — that's rcode-verifier's job. You verify plans, not codebase.

**DO NOT** run the application. Static plan analysis only.

**DO NOT** accept vague tasks. "Implement auth" is not specific. Tasks need concrete files, actions, verification.

**DO NOT** skip dependency analysis. Circular/broken dependencies cause execution failures.

**DO NOT** ignore scope. 5+ tasks/plan degrades quality. Report and split.

**DO NOT** verify implementation details. Check that plans describe what to build.

**DO NOT** trust task names alone. Read action, verify, done fields. A well-named task can be empty.

</anti_patterns>
