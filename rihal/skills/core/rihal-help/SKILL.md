# Rihal Help

## Overview

Help skill for Rihal Code.

## Purpose

Help the user understand where they are in their Rihal workflow and what to do next. Answer Rihal questions when asked.

## Desired Outcomes

When this skill completes, the user should:

1. **Know where they are** — which module and phase they're in, what's already been completed
2. **Know what to do next** — the next recommended and/or required step, with clear reasoning
3. **Know how to invoke it** — skill name, menu code, action context, and any args that shortcut the conversation
4. **Get offered a quick start** — when a single skill is the clear next step, offer to run it for the user right now rather than just listing it
5. **Feel oriented, not overwhelmed** — surface only what's relevant to their current position; don't dump the entire catalog

## Data Sources

- **Catalog**: `{project-root}/.rihal/catalog.json` — assembled manifest of all installed module skills
- **Config**: `config.yaml` and `user-config.yaml` files in `{project-root}/.rihal/` and its subfolders — resolve `output-location` variables, provide `communication_language` and `project_knowledge`
- **Artifacts**: Files matching `outputs` patterns at resolved `output-location` paths reveal which steps are possibly completed; their content may also provide grounding context for recommendations
- **Project knowledge**: If `project_knowledge` resolves to an existing path, read it for grounding context. Never fabricate project-specific details.

## CSV Interpretation

The catalog uses this format:

```
module,skill,display-name,menu-code,description,action,args,phase,after,before,required,output-location,outputs
```

**Phases** determine the high-level flow:
- `anytime` — available regardless of workflow state
- Numbered phases (`1-analysis`, `2-planning`, etc.) flow in order; naming varies by module

**Dependencies** determine ordering within and across phases:
- `after` — skills that should ideally complete before this one
- `before` — skills that should run after this one
- Format: `skill-name` for single-action skills, `skill-name:action` for multi-action skills

**Required gates**:
- `required=true` items must complete before the user can meaningfully proceed to later phases
- A phase with no required items is entirely optional — recommend it but be clear about what's actually required next

**Completion detection**:
- Search resolved output paths for `outputs` patterns
- Fuzzy-match found files to catalog rows
- User may also state completion explicitly, or it may be evident from the current conversation

**Descriptions carry routing context** — some contain cycle info and alternate paths (e.g., "back to DS if fixes needed"). Read them as navigation hints, not just display text.

## Response Format

For each recommended item, present:
- `[menu-code]` **Display name** — e.g., "[CP] Create PRD"
- Skill name in backticks — e.g., `rihal-create-prd`
- For multi-action skills: action invocation context — e.g., "noor lets create a mermaid diagram!"
- Description if present in CSV; otherwise your existing knowledge of the skill suffices
- Args if available

**Ordering**: Show optional items first, then the next required item. Make it clear which is which.

## Constraints

- Present all output in `{communication_language}`
- Recommend running each skill in a **fresh context window**
- Match the user's tone — conversational when they're casual, structured when they want specifics
- If the active module is ambiguous, ask rather than guess

## Output Format

Status summary of current workflow position, then ordered list of recommended next skills with `[menu-code]` **Display name**, skill name in backticks, and description.

## Workflow

1. Read the user request and extract key parameters.
2. Execute the skill logic as described in the Overview.
3. Return output in the format specified below.

## Examples

### Happy path
**User:** "what should I do next?"
**Result:** Detects PRD exists but no stories → recommends `rihal-create-epics-and-stories` → offers to run it

### Edge case
**User:** "help" in an empty project
**Result:** No artifacts found → recommends starting with `rihal-scaffold-project` or `rihal-init`

### Negative boundary
**User:** "help me write a React component"
**Result:** Not a Rihal workflow question → route to `rihal-dev-story` or answer directly

## Memory Bank Hooks

- **Reads:** nothing — `help` is pure reference output
- **Writes:** nothing — read-only
