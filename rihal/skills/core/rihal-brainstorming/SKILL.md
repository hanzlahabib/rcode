## Overview

Facilitate interactive brainstorming sessions using diverse creative techniques and ideation methods.

Structured brainstorming facilitator that guides users through creative ideation using techniques from brain-methods.csv. Aims for 100+ ideas before organizing, using anti-bias protocols to push past obvious solutions.

## Workflow

Follow the instructions in ./workflow.md.

## Output Format

A brainstorming session document saved to `{output_folder}/brainstorming/` containing:
- Session metadata (date, topic, techniques used)
- Raw idea list (numbered, 100+ target)
- Grouped themes after divergent phase
- Top ideas selected by user with rationale

## Examples

### Happy path
**User:** "brainstorm features for our mobile app"
**Result:** Facilitator runs session setup → technique selection → 100+ ideas generated → grouped into themes → user selects top 5

### Edge case
**User:** "brainstorm" (no topic)
**Result:** Facilitator asks clarifying questions about domain, constraints, and goals before starting

### Negative boundary
**User:** "analyze our competitors"
**Result:** Not a brainstorming task → route to `rihal-sadiq-analyst`

Facilitates structured brainstorming with diverse creative techniques — SCAMPER, reverse brainstorming, mind mapping, six thinking hats, and more. Aims for 100+ ideas before organization using anti-bias protocols to push past obvious answers.

Follow the instructions in ./workflow.md.

## Output Format

```markdown
## 🧠 Brainstorming Session — {topic}

### Session Setup
- **Technique:** {technique-name}
- **Participants:** {user} + facilitator
- **Goal:** {session-goal}

### Ideas (Raw)
1. {idea-1}
2. {idea-2}
...

### Clusters
| Cluster | Ideas | Top Pick |
|---------|-------|----------|
| {name}  | #1, #5, #12 | {best} |

### Next Steps
- [ ] {action-1}
- [ ] {action-2}
```

## Examples

### Happy path
**User:** "brainstorm ways to improve our onboarding flow"
**Result:** Facilitator runs SCAMPER + reverse brainstorming, generates 40+ ideas, clusters into UX improvements / content changes / automation, surfaces top 5 actionable picks.

### Edge case
**User:** "brainstorm" (no topic)
**Result:** Facilitator asks "What topic or challenge would you like to brainstorm about?" before proceeding.

### Negative boundary
**User:** "brainstorm which tech stack to use"
**Result:** Redirects to `/rihal-council` or Waleed (CTO) — architecture decisions need structured ADR evaluation, not open ideation.

## Memory Bank Hooks

- **Reads:** `.rihal/memory/project/glossary.md` (so generated ideas use project domain terms)
- **Writes:** the brainstorm output document at the user-specified path; if any idea becomes a committed direction, the user should run `rcode-memory-update` to log it as a decision
