  Write an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) to lock a significant

  architecture decision", "document this architectural choice", "write an
  architecture record", "lock this technical decision", or "record the
  decision to use X". Do NOT use for implementation code (use
  rihal-dev-story) or sprint planning (use rihal-sprint-planning).
triggers:
  - "write an ADR"

## Overview

Write an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) to lock a significant technical decision.

## Workflow

Follow the instructions in ./workflow.md.

## Output Format

- ADR file structure is fixed: Title | Status | Date | Decider | Context | Decision | Consequences | Alternatives Considered
- Saved to .rihal/decisions/{NNN}-{slug}.md with sequential numbering
- Status values: Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded
- At least 2 alternatives considered, each with explicit rejection reason
- Do NOT skip the Alternatives section — it's the most important part

## Examples

### Happy Path
**Input:** "Create an ADR for choosing Postgres over MongoDB"
**Expected behavior:** Ask for context (what project, constraints). Produce ADR with Context, Decision (Postgres), Consequences (trade-offs both ways), Alternatives (MongoDB rejected because X, SQLite rejected because Y).

### Edge Case: Insufficient Justification
**Input:** "ADR: we're using React"
**Expected behavior:** Refuse to write a one-liner ADR. Ask: "What did you reject (Vue, Svelte, Angular)? What trade-offs did you weigh? An ADR without alternatives is a note, not a decision record."
