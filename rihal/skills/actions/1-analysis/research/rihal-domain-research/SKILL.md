## Overview

Conduct industry domain deep-dive research to build subject matter expertise on a specific business domain.

## Workflow

Follow the instructions in ./workflow.md.

## Output Format

- Report: Domain Overview | Key Players | Terminology Glossary | Common Workflows | Regulatory Notes | References
- Every claim cited with a source URL or flagged as assumption
- Saved to .rihal/artifacts/research/domain-{slug}.md
- Do NOT include unsourced statistics

## Examples

### Happy Path
**Input:** "Research the real estate brokerage domain in Oman"
**Expected behavior:** Multi-source research, produce report with glossary of Omani real estate terms, regulatory citations, and key players.

### Edge Case: Narrow Domain
**Input:** "Research quantum basket weaving"
**Expected behavior:** Report: "Insufficient verifiable sources. Can narrow or pivot to adjacent domain?"
