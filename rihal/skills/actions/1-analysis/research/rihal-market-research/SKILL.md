## Overview

Analyze market size, competitive landscape, customer needs, and trends for a product or industry.

## Workflow

Follow the instructions in ./workflow.md.

## Output Format

- Report: TAM/SAM/SOM (with sources) | Direct Competitors (3-5) | Indirect Alternatives | Customer Segments | Trends | Recommendation
- Every number cites a source
- Saved to .rihal/artifacts/research/market-{slug}.md
- Do NOT invent market sizes

## Examples

### Happy Path
**Input:** "Market research for AI legal assistants in the GCC"
**Expected behavior:** Source-backed TAM/SAM/SOM, competitor scan, segment analysis, recommendation.

### Edge Case: Niche Market
**Input:** (tiny addressable market)
**Expected behavior:** Report honestly: "SAM is ~$X — may be too small for VC-scale investment. Consider adjacency or pivot."
