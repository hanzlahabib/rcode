## Overview

Guide through realizing a UX design that informs architecture and implementation — user flows, wireframes, design system updates.

## Workflow

Follow the instructions in ./workflow.md.

## Output Format

- UX spec saved to .rihal/artifacts/ux/{slug}.md
- Fixed sections: User Goal | Flow Steps | Screens with States | Design Tokens Used | Accessibility Notes
- All UI states listed (default/hover/focus/empty/loading/error/success)
- Accessibility notes cite WCAG 2.1 AA criteria
- Do NOT skip UI states

## Examples

### Happy Path
**Input:** "Create the UX design for password reset"
**Expected behavior:** Ask about user goal and constraints, map flow, define screens with all states, reference design system tokens, note a11y.

### Edge Case: No Design System
**Input:** (no design system exists)
**Expected behavior:** Respond: "No design system found. Either establish base tokens first, or I'll propose minimal ones and flag for later formalization."
