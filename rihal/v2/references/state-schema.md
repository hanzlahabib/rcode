## Usage Examples

### Reading Phase Progress
```python
current_phase = state['current_phase']
completed_phases = [p for p in state['phases'] if p['completed'] is not None]
progress = f"{len(completed_phases)}/{len(state['phases'])} phases complete"
```

### Checking for Blockers
```python
unresolved_blockers = [b for b in state['blockers'] if b['resolved'] is None]
if unresolved_blockers:
    print(f"⚠️ {len(unresolved_blockers)} open blockers")
```

### Resuming Session
```python
last_session = state['last_session']
current_phase = state['current_phase']
# Provide context: "Last session: {last_session}. Phase: {current_phase}"
```

### Tracking Decisions
```python
phase_decisions = [d for d in state['decisions'] if d['phase'] == current_phase]
print(f"Decisions made in {current_phase}:")
for d in phase_decisions:
    print(f"  - {d['summary']}")
```

## ID Formats Accepted by resolve-id

The `state resolve-id <id>` command accepts the following formats:

| Format | Example | Resolves To | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------|
| `M{N}` | `M1`, `M2` | Milestone N | Lowercase or uppercase M |
| `{NN}` | `01`, `02`, `10` | Phase with number NN | Zero-padded two-digit phase number |
| `{NN.M}` | `02.1`, `03.2` | Decimal phase (decimal phase) OR plan NN.M | Interpreted based on context—if decimal phase exists, refers to that; otherwise plan ID |
| `{NN.M.T}` | `01.02.03`, `02.01.05` | Task T in plan NN.M | Three-part hierarchical task ID |

**Examples:**
```bash
node .rihal/bin/rihal-tools.cjs state resolve-id M1          # → Milestone 1
node .rihal/bin/rihal-tools.cjs state resolve-id 02          # → Phase 02
node .rihal/bin/rihal-tools.cjs state resolve-id 02.1        # → Phase 02.1 (decimal) or Plan 02.01
node .rihal/bin/rihal-tools.cjs state resolve-id 02.01.03    # → Task 3 in Plan 02.01
```

Use these IDs in `/rihal:plan show <id>` or `/rihal:execute <id>` commands.
