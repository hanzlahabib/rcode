# Workflow: rihal:enable-hooks

<purpose>
Merge Rihal opt-in hooks from settings-hooks.json into .claude/settings.json. Creates settings.json if missing. Enables pre-edit (read-before-edit check), pre-workflow (command hint), and post-commit (format validation) guardrails.
</purpose>

## Step 1 — Load hooks template

```bash
cat .rihal/templates/settings-hooks.json
```

Parse the JSON. If file does not exist, print error and stop:

```
Error: .rihal/templates/settings-hooks.json not found. Run 'rihal-code install-v2' to reinstall.
```

## Step 2 — Load or create settings.json

Check if `.claude/settings.json` exists in the project root.

- **If it exists:** Read and parse it. Merge incoming hooks into the existing `hooks` object (or create if missing).
- **If it does not exist:** Create a minimal settings.json with the hooks from step 1.

If `.claude/` directory does not exist, create it first.

## Step 3 — Merge hooks

For each hook type (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`):

- If the hook type does not exist in the current settings.json, add it.
- If it exists, append the new matchers and hook commands (avoid duplicates by checking for exact command matches).

**Duplicate detection:** If a matcher + command pair already exists, skip it.

## Step 4 — Write merged settings.json

Write the merged settings.json back to `.claude/settings.json` with proper JSON formatting (2-space indent).

## Step 5 — Print confirmation

Print success message:

```
✓ Rihal hooks installed to .claude/settings.json

Enabled guardrails:
  • pre-edit: Verifies files are Read() before Edit/Write
  • pre-workflow: Warns if rihal:* commands look suspicious
  • post-commit: Validates commit format and bans "Generated with Claude" patterns

To disable, remove the hooks section from .claude/settings.json or edit .rihal/templates/settings-hooks.json and re-run.
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `.claude/settings.json` created or updated with hooks merged
- [ ] No duplicate hook entries in merged settings
- [ ] File written with valid JSON formatting
- [ ] Confirmation message printed to user

## On Error

- **Template not found:** print error and stop (Step 1).
- **`.claude/` directory creation fails:** print error and stop.
- **state.json missing:** continue without error — hooks installation is standalone.
- **settings.json has invalid JSON:** print error with path and stop.
- **Permission denied writing .claude/settings.json:** print error and stop.
- **Merge produces duplicate hooks:** skip duplicates (Step 3).
