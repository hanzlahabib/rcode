<purpose>
Orchestrate parallel debug agents to investigate issues and find root causes.

After identifying issues, spawn one debug agent per issue. Each agent investigates autonomously with symptoms pre-filled. Collect root causes, then hand off to plan with actual diagnoses.

Orchestrator stays lean: parse issues, spawn agents, collect results, synthesize findings.
</purpose>

<available_agent_types>
Valid Rihal subagent types (use exact names — do not fall back to 'general-purpose'):
- rihal-debugger — Diagnoses and fixes issues
</available_agent_types>

<paths>
DEBUG_DIR=.rihal/debug

Debug files use the `.rihal/debug/` path (hidden directory with leading dot).
</paths>

<core_principle>
**Diagnose before planning fixes.**

Issue identification tells us WHAT is broken (symptoms). Debug agents find WHY (root cause). Future planning then creates targeted fixes based on actual causes, not guesses.

Without diagnosis: "Feature doesn't work" → guess at fix → maybe wrong
With diagnosis: "Feature doesn't work" → "missing error handler" → precise fix
</core_principle>

## Step 0.5 — Detect non-bug questions (redirect)

If input contains "should we", "what is the best way to", "how do I implement" — these are not bugs, they are how-to or strategy questions.

```
⚠ /rihal:debug investigates broken behavior, not how-to questions.

For implementation guidance: /rihal:discuss waleed $ARGUMENTS
For a strategic decision: /rihal:council $ARGUMENTS
```

Only proceed past this step if the input describes broken or unexpected behavior (e.g., "error X occurs", "feature Y doesn't work", "API returns wrong data").

<process>

<step name="parse_issues">
**Extract issues from context:**

From the conversation or provided input, identify:
- What is broken or not working (truth/expected behavior)
- Severity: blocker, major, minor
- Reproduction steps or context
- Any error messages or symptoms

Build issue list:
```
issues = [
  {truth: "Feature X doesn't work", severity: "major", context: "..."},
  {truth: "API returns wrong data", severity: "blocker", context: "..."},
  ...
]
```
</step>

<step name="report_plan">
**Report diagnosis plan to user:**

```
## Diagnosing {N} Issues

Spawning parallel debug agents to investigate root causes:

| Issue (Truth) | Severity |
|---------------|----------|
| Feature X doesn't work | major |
| API returns wrong data | blocker |

Each agent will:
1. Create DEBUG-{slug}.md with symptoms pre-filled
2. Investigate autonomously (read code, form hypotheses, test)
3. Return root cause

This runs in parallel - all issues investigated simultaneously.
```
</step>

<step name="spawn_agents">
**Load agent skills:**

```bash
AGENT_SKILLS_DEBUGGER=$(node .rihal/bin/rihal-tools.cjs agent-skills rihal-debugger 2>/dev/null)
```

**Spawn debug agents in parallel:**

For each issue, fill the debug-subagent-prompt template and spawn:

```
Task(
  prompt=filled_debug_subagent_prompt + "\n\n<files_to_read>\n- .rihal/STATE.md\n</files_to_read>\n${AGENT_SKILLS_DEBUGGER}",
  subagent_type="rihal-debugger",
  isolation="worktree",
  description="Debug: {truth_short}"
)
```

**All agents spawn in single message** (parallel execution).

Template placeholders:
- `{truth}`: The expected behavior that failed
- `{expected}`: What should happen
- `{actual}`: What actually happens
- `{errors}`: Any error messages (or "None reported")
- `{context}`: Reproduction context
- `{goal}`: `find_root_cause_only`
- `{slug}`: Generated from truth
</step>

<step name="collect_results">
**Collect root causes from agents:**

Each agent returns with:
```
## ROOT CAUSE FOUND

**Debug Session:** ${DEBUG_DIR}/{slug}.md

**Root Cause:** {specific cause with evidence}

**Evidence Summary:**
- {key finding 1}
- {key finding 2}
- {key finding 3}

**Files Involved:**
- {file1}: {what's wrong}
- {file2}: {related issue}

**Suggested Fix Direction:** {brief hint for planning}
```

Parse each return to extract:
- root_cause: The diagnosed cause
- files: Files involved
- debug_path: Path to debug session file
- suggested_fix: Hint for fix planning

If agent returns `## INVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE`:
- root_cause: "Investigation inconclusive - manual review needed"
- Note which issue needs manual attention
- Include remaining possibilities from agent return
</step>

<step name="report_results">
**Report diagnosis results:**

 RIHAL ► DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE

| Issue (Truth) | Root Cause | Files |
|---------------|------------|-------|
| Feature X doesn't work | Missing error handler | handler.ts |
| API wrong data | Query missing filter | api.ts |

Debug sessions: ${DEBUG_DIR}/

Next: Use diagnosed root causes to plan fixes.
```

Provide quick command to review findings and plan next steps.
</step>

</process>

<context_efficiency>
Agents start with symptoms pre-filled from issue context (no symptom gathering).
Agents only diagnose—planning handles fixes (no fix application).
</context_efficiency>

<failure_handling>
**Agent fails to find root cause:**
- Mark issue as "needs manual review"
- Continue with other issues
- Report incomplete diagnosis

**Agent times out:**
- Check DEBUG-{slug}.md for partial progress
- Can resume investigation

**All agents fail:**
- Something systemic (permissions, git, etc.)
- Report for manual investigation
- Fall back to manual debugging
</failure_handling>

- [ ] Issues parsed from context
- [ ] Debug agents spawned in parallel
- [ ] Root causes collected from all agents
- [ ] Debug sessions saved to ${DEBUG_DIR}/
