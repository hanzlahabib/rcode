<purpose>
Display the Rihal command reference at the requested tier. Output ONLY the tier section. Do NOT add project-specific analysis, git status, next-step suggestions, or any commentary beyond the reference.
</purpose>

## Step 0 — Parse arguments

Read `$ARGUMENTS` and resolve to one of: `basic`, `intermediate`, `advanced`, `all`.

| Input | Tier shown |
|-------|------------|
| (empty) or `basic` or `1` | **TIER 1 — Basic** |
| `intermediate` or `int` or `2` | **TIER 2 — Intermediate** |
| `advanced` or `adv` or `3` | **TIER 3 — Advanced** |
| `all` or `full` | **All three tiers in sequence** |
| `--help` or `-h` | Show usage block, then exit |

Usage block:

```
Usage: /rihal:help [basic|intermediate|advanced|all]

  basic         Show the 8 essentials (default)
  intermediate  Show real-project ops (council, review, ship, capture)
  advanced      Show power tools (audits, workspaces, council variants, etc.)
  all           Show everything
```

## Step 1 — Render the requested tier

Output the matching `<tier-N>` block below verbatim. For `all`, output all three blocks separated by `---`.

<tier-1>
# Rihal — Tier 1 (Basic)

> **Rihal** is council-driven project automation built for solo agentic work in Claude Code.
> Tier 1 is everything you need to ship a small project end-to-end. **8 commands.**

## The loop

```
init → new-project → plan → execute → next → status → ship
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/rihal:init` | First-time setup in this repo. Detects state, asks config questions, writes `.rihal/RIHLA.md`. Run once per project. |
| `/rihal:new-project` | Take an idea to a planned roadmap. Questioning → optional research → REQUIREMENTS → ROADMAP. |
| `/rihal:plan <phase>` | Create executable plans for a phase. Produces `SPRINT.md` files. |
| `/rihal:execute <phase>` | Run all plans in a phase in dependency waves. Updates STATE on completion. |
| `/rihal:next` | Auto-route to the next logical step based on project state. Zero friction. |
| `/rihal:status` | Where am I — current phase, plan progress, recent decisions, blockers. |
| `/rihal:progress` | Visual progress + intelligent suggestion for next action. |
| `/rihal:help [tier]` | This reference. Add `intermediate`, `advanced`, or `all` for more. |

## Minimal happy path

```
/rihal:init
/rihal:new-project
/rihal:plan 1
/rihal:execute 1
/rihal:next
```

## Files Rihal creates

```
.planning/
├── PROJECT.md            # vision
├── REQUIREMENTS.md       # scoped requirements
├── ROADMAP.md            # phase breakdown
├── STATE.md              # project memory
└── phases/
    └── 01-foundation/
        ├── 01-01-SPRINT.md   # the plan
        └── 01-01-SUMMARY.md  # what got done
```

**Done with Tier 1?** → `/rihal:help intermediate` for council, review, ship, and capture.
</tier-1>

## Capture & session continuity

| Command | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/rihal:note "<text>"` | Zero-friction idea capture — appends to dated note file. |

## Common compound flows

**New project (full quality):**
```
/rihal:new-project → /clear → /rihal:plan 1 → /clear → /rihal:execute 1 → /rihal:verify-phase 1 → /rihal:ship
```

**Mid-milestone urgent work:**
```
/rihal:insert-phase 5 "Critical security fix" → /rihal:plan 5.1 → /rihal:execute 5.1
```

**Resume after break:**
```
/rihal:resume-work   # or just /rihal:next
```

**Debug across context resets:**
```
/rihal:debug "form submission fails" → ...investigation... → /clear → /rihal:debug   # resumes
```

**Complete + start next milestone:**
```
/rihal:audit-milestone → /rihal:plan-milestone-gaps → /rihal:complete-milestone 1.0.0 → /rihal:new-milestone
```

## Configuration reference

`.planning/config.json`:

```json
{
  "mode": "interactive",            // or "yolo"
  "planning": {
    "commit_docs": true,            // false = .planning/ kept local
    "search_gitignored": false      // true = ripgrep with --no-ignore
  }
}
```

## Where to find context

- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — vision
- `.planning/STATE.md` — current memory
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — phase status
- `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md` — living retrospective
- `.planning/codebase/` — brownfield maps (STACK, ARCHITECTURE, etc.)

**End of reference.**
</tier-3>

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Correct tier section is rendered based on `$ARGUMENTS`
- [ ] No extra analysis, commentary, or project state added
- [ ] "Next tier" pointer present at end of Tier 1 and Tier 2
- [ ] `all` renders all three tiers separated by `---`
- [ ] Unknown args fall back to Tier 1 silently (do not error)

## On Error

- If unable to load or render reference: display fallback `See rihal/workflows/help.md for full reference`
- Handle missing sections gracefully without breaking output
