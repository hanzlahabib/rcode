## Overview

Run an epic retrospective that reviews completed work, extracts learnings, and produces owned action items.

## Workflow

Follow the instructions in ./workflow.md.

## Output Format

- Fixed structure: Went Well | Went Poorly | Start Doing | Stop Doing | Continue Doing | Action Items
- Every action item has an owner and a deadline — no "we should..." without a name
- Saved to .rihal/progress/retro-{date}.md
- Do NOT include vague action items

## Examples

### Happy Path
**Input:** "Run retro for the sprint we just finished"
**Expected behavior:** Gather answers to all 5 categories, convert insights to owned action items with deadlines, save.

### Edge Case: No One Owns Actions
**Input:** "Action item: improve testing"
**Expected behavior:** Refuse. Respond: "This is a wish, not an action. Who owns it? By when? Restate as: 'Fatima sets up Playwright on staging by Friday.'"
