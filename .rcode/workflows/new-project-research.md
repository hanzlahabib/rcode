# Subworkflow: new-project — Research Phase

<purpose>
Research phase of /rcode-new-project. Loaded from new-project.md via @-reference when user opts into research. Produces research artifacts that feed into Step 7 (Define Requirements) and Step 8 (Create Roadmap).

**Invariants from parent:** {project_name}, {planning_artifacts}, {researcher_model}, {synthesizer_model}, {user_preference_research}. Set in new-project.md Steps 1–5.5 before this loads.
</purpose>

## 6. Research Decision

**If auto mode:** Default to "Research first" without asking.

Use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Research"
- question: "Research the domain ecosystem before defining requirements?"
- options:
  - "Research first (Recommended)" — Discover standard stacks, expected features, architecture patterns
  - "Skip research" — I know this domain well, go straight to requirements

**If "Research first":**

Display stage banner:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 rcode ► RESEARCHING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Researching [domain] ecosystem...
```

Create research directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .planning/research
```

**Determine milestone context:**

Check if this is greenfield or subsequent milestone:

- If no "Validated" requirements in PROJECT.md → Greenfield (building from scratch)
- If "Validated" requirements exist → Subsequent milestone (adding to existing app)

Task(prompt="<research_type>
Project Research — Stack dimension for [domain].
</research_type>

<objective>
Identify the standard stack for [domain].

Why this matters: this research feeds requirements definition and roadmap
creation for {project_name}. A sufficient result lets the roadmap pick
concrete libraries (with versions and rationale) and sequence build phases —
not a vague survey of options.
</objective>

<milestone_context>
[greenfield OR subsequent]

Greenfield: Research the standard stack for building [domain] from scratch.
Subsequent: Research what's needed to add [target features] to an existing [domain] app. Don't re-research the existing system.

<objective>
Identify the feature landscape for [domain].

Why this matters: this research feeds requirements definition and roadmap
creation for {project_name}. A sufficient result lets requirements separate
table stakes from differentiators and anti-features — not an undifferentiated
feature list.
</objective>

creation for {project_name}. A sufficient result lets the roadmap sequence
phases by component dependency and data flow — not a generic architecture
sketch.

Why this matters: this research feeds requirements definition and roadmap
creation for {project_name}. A sufficient result lets the roadmap assign each
pitfall a prevention step in a specific phase — not a generic warning list.

**Sufficiency loop (per dimension, runs before synthesis):**

@.rcode/references/iterative-retrieval.md

After the 4 parallel researchers return, evaluate each dimension's returned
artifact (STACK / FEATURES / ARCHITECTURE / PITFALLS) for sufficiency against
that dimension's `<objective>` — does it cover every sub-question, are
recommendations specific (versions/rationale) not vague, and were any
`## RESEARCH INCONCLUSIVE` or blocked signals returned. For any dimension
that is insufficient, re-dispatch that dimension's `rcode-project-researcher`
with a follow-up prompt naming the specific gaps and including the prior
result, asking only for the missing pieces. This loop is hard-capped at 3
cycles per dimension (initial + up to 2 follow-ups). After the cap, proceed
with the best result for that dimension and note residual gaps in its
artifact. Only then continue to synthesis.

After all 4 agents complete and the sufficiency loop has settled, spawn
synthesizer to create SUMMARY.md:

```
Task(prompt="
<task>
Synthesize research outputs into SUMMARY.md.
</task>

<files_to_read>
