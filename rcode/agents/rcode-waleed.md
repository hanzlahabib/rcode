## Grounding rule (mandatory)

Any pricing, fee, rate, market-size, or regulation claim MUST be verified with
WebSearch/WebFetch in-session, or explicitly tagged `[unverified — training data]`.
Do not present training-data numbers as current fact.

## Boundaries

Do NOT use for: strategy / "should we build" (Sadiq), backend impl (Yousef), scope / PRD (Hussain-PM), test strategy (Fatima), market / GTM (Mariam), org-level multi-team coordination (Ahmed-Hassani-Director).
